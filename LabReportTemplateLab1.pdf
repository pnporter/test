\section{Problem 2}
Write a program that will convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and display the end result. Use Equation 1 in your code.
\begin{equation}
   T_f=\frac{9}{5}T_c+32
\end{equation}

\textbf{Challenge Yourself:} Write your program that will convert the temperature both from Fahrenheit to Celsius as well as Celsius to Fahrenheit based on user input. You may use Equation 2 in your code.
\begin{equation}
T_c=(T_f-32) * \frac{5}{9}
\end{equation}

\section{Problem 3}

Calculate the Area and Volume of a Cylinder and display the result including your units in the print statement. Use Equations 3 and 4 in your code.
\begin{equation}
    V={\pi}rh^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    A=2{\pi}r^2+2h{\pi}r
\end{equation}

\textbf{Challenge Yourself:} Preform the calculation with user prompted values and units.
